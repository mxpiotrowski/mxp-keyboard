# mxp-keyboard

Custom keyboard layout for macOS.

Based on a German layout (without deadkeys); except for Alt-l, which produces `Å‚` rather than `@`, all keys correspond to their labels.

Deadkeys for producing a large number of accented characters are available using Alt (the arrangement of the first row ultimately goes back to HP-UX):

- Alt-r: acute
- Alt-t: grave
- Alt-z: circumflex
- Alt-u: umlaut/dieresis
- Alt-i: tilde
- Alt-f: ring
- Alt-g: macron
- Alt-h: combining superscript letters
- Alt-j: double acute
- Alt-k: ogonek
- Alt-v: caron
- Alt-b: breve
- Alt-n: tilde
- Alt-,: cedilla/comma below
- Alt-.: dot above
